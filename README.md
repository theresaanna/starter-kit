Download the ZIP to get started with Ember.js: <https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit/downloads>

The starter kit provides a very basic "Hello World!" site framework for you to begin building your Ember.js app on. It includes a basic CSS reset, favicon and standard iOS mobile device icons from <http://html5boilerplate.com>. 'js/app.js' is where you'll start building your app.

jQuery is included via a protocol-relative URL, or network-path reference. This means that you will need to load your app using a web server like Apache, Nginx, etc, or you will receive errors when trying to load your index.html. For more on protocol-relative URLs: <http://paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url>.
